Create a class that models a box, with instance variables for height, width, and depth making each an integer. 
Then create an application class that asks the user to enter the width, height, and depth of a box, creates an instance of the 
first class and finally displays the volume of that box.

Hint: The java.util.Scanner class offers a method for capturing a string from
the console.

String str = new Scanner(System.in).nextLine();
